    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
       Lindsey Scholl is a Christian early childhood educator with a specialization in infant development, a psalmist, devoted wife, 
       and proud dog mom to an adorable Yorkshire Terrier named Lady Grace. Her love for music began before she could even speak—she was singing by the age of 18 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout her life, Lindsey has faced many challenges and has often turned to the gift of song as a source of comfort, healing, and expression. 
        This book is a heartfelt tribute to her beloved mother, who passed away on January 6, 2023. For over 33 years, they sang together in church and other settings, 
        sharing not just their voices, but a deep bond through music and faith.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lindsey currently lives in Ohio, with her husband and their sweet pup, Lady Grace. 
        Silvia the Songbird – How Silvia Got Her Song is her debut Christian children’s book, inspired by her own journey, her faith, 
        and the musical legacy she shared with her mother.
